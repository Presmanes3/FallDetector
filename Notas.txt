Waist-mounted smartphone 

Detections:

- Vertical activity
- Lying
- Sitting or Static Standing
- Horizontal activity
- Fall

1. Data collection:
	- Body movements are centered at 20Hz
	- Sampling frequency for accelerometer >= 40Hz

2. Data preprocessing
System readings will be composed of:
	- Body movement
	- Gravitationsl acceleration
	- External vibrations (noise)
	- Bouncing of the sensor against other objects (noise)


In order to attenuate the noise we will use a median filter with order 3.

3. Feature extraction
We need to extract the following features:

	- SMA (Signal Magnitude Area): used to measure the degree of change of human movement, the greater the number, the more violent motiton state.

	- SVM (Signal magnitude Vector): Mathematic magnitude of the acceleration vector.

	- TA (Tilt Angle): Indicates the angle of the mobile phone with respect to the Y-axis. In a vertical position, this number should be 0-degrees.

4. Classification algorithm
Basic FSM with some defined states and conditions.
